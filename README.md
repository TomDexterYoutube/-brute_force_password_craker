download python3 or newer then run setup.bat
than you can put what you want into data.txt or run brute_force_file_gen.py
after that run brute_force_file_run.py and set the delay (recommended 0.1 the lower the faster) after that click into a text box (it will take 10 seconds to start) 
IMPORTANT DO NOT PRESS ANY BUTTONS WHILE IT IS RUNNING IF YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING PRESS THE PAUSE BUTTON OR CLOSE THE TAB
note that the needed delay changes depending what your typing into
for cmd and python the minimum delay is 0.000
