download python3 or newer than run setup.bat
than you can put what you want into data.txt or run brute_force_file_gen.py
after that run brute_force_file_gen.py and click on what you want it to type into
IMPORTANT DO NOT PRESS ANY BUTTONS WHILE IT IS RUNNING IF YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING PRESS THE PAUSE BUTTON OR CLOSE THE TAB
